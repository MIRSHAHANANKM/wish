Every moment with you feels like a beautiful dream I never want to wake up from.
You are the light in my life, the smile in my heart, and the warmth in my soul.
Iâ€™m so lucky to walk this journey with you â€” hand in hand, heart to heart.

Hereâ€™s to celebrating you â€” the one who makes my world brighter every single day.
May your birthday be filled with as much joy, magic, and love as you bring into my life.
I canâ€™t wait to create a lifetime of memories with you.</p>
